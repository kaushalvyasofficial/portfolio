      "The act of creation is singular, as is the moment of creation, and the result is something fresh and strange.",
      "Today's \"best practices\" lead to dead ends; the best paths are new and untried.",
      "The history of progress is a history of better monopoly businesses replacing incumbents. Monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate.",
      "Competition is an ideology - the ideology - that pervades our society and distorts our thinking. We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its commandments; and as a result, we trap ourselves within it - even though the more we compete, the less we gain.",
      "Sometimes you do have to fight. Where that's true, you should fight and win. There is no middle ground: either don't throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly.",
      "It's not surprise that entitlement spending has eclipsed discretionary spending every year since 1975.",
      "In exchange for better insurance contracts, we seem to have given up the search for secrets about longevity. Systematic knowledge of the current stage of human lifespans has made that range seem natural.",
      "Indefinite optimism seems inherently unsustainable: how can the future get better if no one plans for it?",
      "When a big company makes an offer to acquire a successful startup, it almost always offers too much or too little: founders only sell when they have no more concrete visions for the company, in which case the acquirer probably overpaid; definite founders with robust plans don't sell, which means the offer wasn't high enough.",
      "\"it doesn't matter what you do, as long as you do it well.\" That is completely false. It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on something you're good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.",
      "The most important things are singular. . .  Time and decision-making themselves follow a power law, and some moments matter far more than others.",
      "Very few people, if any, could ever understand all its (String Theory's) implications, But is that just because it's difficult? Or is it an impossible mystery? The difference matters. You can achieve difficult things, but you can't achieve the impossible.",
      "The few who knew what might be learned, Foolish enough to put their whole heart on show, And reveal their feelings to the crowd below, Mankind has always crucified and burned. ~ Faust",
      "The Road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began. Still round the corner there may wait A new road or a secret gate, And though we pass them by today, Tomorrow we may come this way And take the hidden paths that run Towards the Moon or to the Sun. ~ Tolkien",
      "A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed. ~ Theil's Law",
      "No company has a culture; every company is a culture.",
      "We have let ourselves become enchanted by big data only because we exoticize technology.",
      "No sector will ever be so important that merely participating in it will be enough to build a great company.",
      "Perhaps every modern king is just a scapegoat who has managed to delay his own execution.",
      "He (Howard Hughes) liked to remind people that he was a mere mortal, not a Greek god - something that mortals say only when they want to invite comparisons to gods.",
      "The 7 Important Business Questions: 1. Engineering - Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements? 2. Timing - Is now the right time to start your particular business? 3. Monopoly - Are you starting with a big share of a small market? 4. People - Do you have the right team? 5. Distribution - Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product? 6. Durability - Will your market position be defensible 10-20 years into the future? 7. Secret - Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?",
      "What the Singularity would look like matters less than the stark choice we face today between the two most likely scenarios: nothing or something. It's up to us. We cannot take for granted that the future will be bet-ter, and that means we need to work to create it today."

    "bookName": "Leaders Eat Last",

    "genre": "Self-Help/ Leadership",
    "dateOfCompletion": "2025-04-11",
    "quotes": [
      "When you are with Marines gathering to eat, you will notice that the most junior are served first and the most senior are served last. At the heart of this very simple action is the Marine Corps' approach to leadership.",
      "Marine leaders are expected to eat last because the true price of leadership is the willingness to place the needs of others above your own... true cost of the leadership privilege comes at the expense of self-interest.",
      "\"If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.\"",
      "\"There are dates worse than death,\" ... \"One date worse than death is accidentally killing your own men. Another fate worse than death is going home alive when twenty-two others don't.\"",
      "\"First of all,\" Campbell asked, \"if I tell the truth, will I still have a job tomorrow?\" Chapman smiled. \"If you have any trouble tomorrow about what you say today,\" he assured him, \"you give me a call.\"",
      "\"When you have people who trust you, they're going to do a better job for you to earn or keep that trust.\"",
      "When the people have to manage dangers from inside the organization, the organization itself becomes less able to face the dangers from outside.",
      "Chapman and others like him didn't set out to change their employees - they set out to change the conditions in which their employees operate. To create cultures that inspire people to give all they have to give simply because they love where they work.",
      "The whole purpose of maintaining the Circle of Safety is so that we can invest all our time and energy to guard against the dangers outside. It's the same reason we lock our doors at night. Not only does feeling safe inside give us peace of mind, but the positive impact on the organization itself is remarkable. When the Circle is strong and that feeling of belonging is ubiquitous, collaboration, trust and innovation result.",
      "We cannot tell people to trust us. We cannot instruct people to come up with big ideas. And we certainly can't demand that people cooperate. These are always results-the results of feeling safe and trusted among the people with whom we work.",
      "Misery may love company, but it is the companies that love misery that suffer the most.",
      "\"It's possible, in other words, that the feeling of being in charge of one's own life more than makes up for the greater amount of responsibility that accompanies higher rungs on the social ladder,\" wrote Max McClure, of the Stanford News Service, in announcing the findings.",
      "Those only doing as they are told, always forced to follow the rules, are the ones who suffer the most. Our feelings of control, stress, and our ability to perform at our best are all directly tied to how safe we feel in our organizations.",
      "...a child's sense of well-being is affected less by the long hours their parents put in at work and more by the mood their parents are in when they come home.",
      "Our ancestors were born dirt poor. Opportunities didn't come their way because of the schools they went to or who their parents knew. Any opportunities came from their will and hard work to create them. And create them they did.",
      "Our species was built to manage in conditions of great danger and insufficient resources. Life in Paleolithic times was not like the aftermath of a hurricane. That's not scarcity, that's destruction. Our ancestors were not the stereotypical cavemen we like to imagine.",
      "Unlike other animals able to communicate, we're capable of syntax and grammar. But another critical reason we survived was thanks to our remarkable ability to co-operate. We are a highly social species whose survival and ability to prosper depend on the help of others.",
      "E.D.S.O. - Without Selfish Chemicals, We Would Starve to Death. Without Social Chemicals, We'd Be Cold-Blooded. E - Endorphins: The Runner's High; D - Dopamine: An Incentive for Progress; S - Serotonin: The Leadership Chemicals; O - Oxytocin: Chemicals Love",
      "Two chemicals-endorphins and dopamine-are the reason that we are driven to hunt, gather and achieve. They make us feel good when we find something we're looking for, build something we need or accomplish our goals. These are the chemicals of progress.",
      "Love is giving someone the power to destroy us and trusting they won't use it."
